## Context & Objective

The second-hand phone business/industry is poised for significant growth in the near to medium future with the IDC (Internation Data Corporation) predicting a whooping \$52.7bn by 2023 with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.6% from 2018 to 2023.

There are many advantages to using a used cell phone:  
1. Significant cost savings with warranties
2. Increases the life of the cell phone - Environmentally friendly 

ReCell is a start-up looking to take advantage of the potential boom in the industry and are looking to use ML to understand the dynamics.

Build a linear regression model that predicts the price of a used phone and identify factors that significantly influence the price. A secondary objective is to identify variables that directly affect the price. This will help with directing the marketing efforts for ReCell.
